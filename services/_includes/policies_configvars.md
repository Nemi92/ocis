## Environment Variables

| Name | Type | Default Value | Description |
|------|------|---------------|-------------|
| POLICIES_GRPC_ADDR | string | 127.0.0.1:9125 | The bind address of the GRPC service.|
| POLICIES_DEBUG_ADDR | string | 127.0.0.1:9129 | Bind address of the debug server, where metrics, health, config and debug endpoints will be exposed.|
| POLICIES_DEBUG_TOKEN | string |  | Token to secure the metrics endpoint.|
| POLICIES_DEBUG_PPROF | bool | false | Enables pprof, which can be used for profiling.|
| POLICIES_DEBUG_ZPAGES | bool | false | Enables zpages, which can be used for collecting and viewing in-memory traces.|
| OCIS_JWT_SECRET<br/>POLICIES_JWT_SECRET | string |  | The secret to mint and validate jwt tokens.|
| OCIS_EVENTS_ENDPOINT<br/>POLICIES_EVENTS_ENDPOINT | string | 127.0.0.1:9233 | The address of the event system. The event system is the message queuing service. It is used as message broker for the microservice architecture.|
| OCIS_EVENTS_CLUSTER<br/>POLICIES_EVENTS_CLUSTER | string | ocis-cluster | The clusterID of the event system. The event system is the message queuing service. It is used as message broker for the microservice architecture. Mandatory when using NATS as event system.|
| OCIS_INSECURE<br/>POLICIES_EVENTS_TLS_INSECURE | bool | false | Whether the server should skip the client certificate verification during the TLS handshake.|
| POLICIES_EVENTS_TLS_ROOT_CA_CERTIFICATE | string |  | The root CA certificate used to validate the server's TLS certificate. If provided POLICIES_EVENTS_TLS_INSECURE will be seen as false.|
| OCIS_EVENTS_ENABLE_TLS<br/>POLICIES_EVENTS_ENABLE_TLS | bool | false | Enable TLS for the connection to the events broker. The events broker is the ocis service which receives and delivers events between the services.|
| REVA_GATEWAY | string | 127.0.0.1:9142 | The CS3 gateway endpoint.|
| OCIS_GRPC_CLIENT_TLS_MODE | string |  | TLS mode for grpc connection to the go-micro based grpc services. Possible values are 'off', 'insecure' and 'on'. 'off': disables transport security for the clients. 'insecure' allows to use transport security, but disables certificate verification (to be used with the autogenerated self-signed certificates). 'on' enables transport security, including server ceritificate verification.|
| OCIS_GRPC_CLIENT_TLS_CACERT | string |  | Path/File name for the root CA certificate (in PEM format) used to validate TLS server certificates of the go-micro based grpc services.|
| OCIS_MACHINE_AUTH_API_KEY<br/>POLICIES_MACHINE_AUTH_API_KEY | string |  | Machine auth API key used to validate internal requests necessary for the access to resources from other services.|
| OCIS_LOG_LEVEL<br/>POLICIES_LOG_LEVEL | string |  | The log level. Valid values are: "panic", "fatal", "error", "warn", "info", "debug", "trace".|
| OCIS_LOG_PRETTY<br/>POLICIES_LOG_PRETTY | bool | false | Activates pretty log output.|
| OCIS_LOG_COLOR<br/>POLICIES_LOG_COLOR | bool | false | Activates colorized log output.|
| OCIS_LOG_FILE<br/>POLICIES_LOG_FILE | string |  | The path to the log file. Activates logging to this file if set.|
| POLICIES_ENGINE_TIMEOUT | Duration | 10s | Sets the timeout the rego expression evaluation can take. The timeout can be set as number followed by a unit identifier like ms, s, etc. Rules default to deny if the timeout was reached.|
| POLICIES_POSTPROCESSING_QUERY | string |  | Defines the 'Complete Rules' variable defined in the rego rule set this step uses for its evaluation. Defaults to deny if the variable was not found.|
