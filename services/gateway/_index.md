## Caching

The `gateway` service can use a configured store via `GATEWAY_CACHE_STORE`. Possible stores are:
  -   `memory`: Basic in-memory store and the default.
  -   `redis`: Stores data in a configured redis cluster.
  -   `etcd`: Stores data in a configured etcd cluster.
1.  Note that in-memory stores are by nature not reboot persistent.
2.  Though usually not necessary, a database name and a database table can be configured for event stores if the event store supports this. Generally not applicable for stores of type `in-memory`. These settings are blank by default which means that the standard settings of the configured store applies.
3.  The gateway service can be scaled if not using `in-memory` stores and the stores are configured identically over all instances.
