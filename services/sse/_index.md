## Abstract


The `sse` service is responsible for sending sse (Server-Sent Events) to a user. See [What is Server-Sent Events](https://medium.com/yemeksepeti-teknoloji/what-is-server-sent-events-sse-and-how-to-implement-it-904938bffd73) for a simple introduction and examples of server sent events.

## Subscribing

Clients can subscribe to the `/sse` endpoint to be informed by the server when an event happens. The `sse` endpoint will respect language changes of the user without needing to reconnect. Note that SSE has a limitation of six open connections per browser which can be reached if one has opened various tabs of the Web UI pointing to the same Infinite Scale instance.
