Change: remove PrivacyURL and ImprintURL from the config

We've removed PrivacyURL and ImprintURL from the config, hence these were living in Web config options,
other clients shouldn't consume those.
In order to be accessible by other clients, not just Web, those should be configured via the theme.json file.
